## Reference/help material

### Data analysis methods

The AI gene expression summary feature analyzes numeric expression data and associated metadata from each experiment for a given gene. For each experiment, the AI generates a concise, one-sentence summary of the gene's expression pattern, along with estimated biological relevance and confidence scores. These per-experiment summaries are then grouped by topic to highlight common patterns, and a final AI-generated paragraph synthesizes the overall expression trends for the gene across all available experiments.
