         A preliminary assembly of <i>C. muris</i> was obtained at approximately 
         4.5 X coverage, and
reveals a ~9Mb genome with average cytosine-guanine content (%GC) of ~28.5
%. This assembly is based on ~50,000 reads obtained mostly from a
small-insert library and a fosmid library. This assembly is estimated to
contain ~ 92% of the ~9Mb genome, and consists of 927 contigs arranged into
595 scaffolds.
<p>
Final assembly, to be released in late summer, will include an additional 2X
coverage obtained from a medium insert library and possibly >5X additional
coverage obtained with 454 pyrosequencing technology. The final assembly is
expected to contain > 99% of the genome.
<p>
Sequencing from the cDNA library provided by Giovanni Widmer is underway.
Average insert length is 1,600 bp. If the library is shown to be random, an
expected >30,000 EST reads will be obtained.
<p>
More information is 
available on the project's website

         New data and queries in CryptoDB 3.5:
<ul>
<li>Proteomics data provided by two labs (Wastling, et al. (updated from CryptoDB 3.4) and Snelling, et al. (new data)) have been loaded, and 
these are visible on the Genome Sequence Browser. Queries to find genes, or ORFs, that show evidence of protein expression based on Mass Spec analyses are also available.</li>
<li><i>C. muris</i> contigs from first draft assembly and translated open reading frames.</li>
<li>Interproscan analysis of <i>Cryptosporidium</i> proteins.</li>
</ul>
<p>
New features in CryptoDB 3.5:
<ul>
<li>We have added <a href="showXmlDataContent.do?name=XmlQuestions.Tutorials">tutorial movies</a> to help you learn about the functionality of our site. 
If there are additional tutorials you would like to see added please submit a request via our <a href="help.jsp">support page</a>.</li>
<li>Most of the queries have been reorganized to make them more intuitive. Some include a new "Advanced Parameters" section. See for example "Identify Genes based on EST evidence."
<li>The columns displayed in query result pages are improved.  The result pages also offer options for sorting, adding new columns, and moving columns around.
<li>Downloading results is improved. A choice of formats is provided including tab-delimited, text, GFF, and FASTA to meet different needs.
  <ul>
  <li>Tab delimited provides an expanded list of annotations that can be directly exported as an Excel spreadsheet.
  <li>Text provides a detailed summary for each gene including protein structures, notes, sequence, and many other choices.
  <li> GFF is a format recognized by many applications such as the genome browser, gbrowse.
  <li> FASTA also provides a common format used for BLAST and other applications. The FASTA option provides the functionality of the SRT (sequence retrieval tool).

The <b><i>Cryptosporidium muris</i> genome sequencing project</b> has been funded by the
National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases (NIAID), through the
Microbial Sequencing Center program at the Institute for Genomic Research
(TIGR). This project aims at obtaining a high-quality assembly of <i>C. muris</i>
genome based on 8X sequence coverage, as well as the comparative automated
and manual curation of gene structure predictions of all three
<i>Cryptosporidium</i> genomes sequenced to date. More information is 
available on the project's website
(<a href="http://msc.tigr.org/c_muris/index.shtml">http://msc.tigr.org/c_muris/index.shtml</a>).
All sequence reads and traces will be deposited with GenBank and the genome
assemblies and annotations will be deposited with GenBank and CryptoDB.

New in this release:
<ul>
<li><b>New Gene Annotations</b>
    <ul><li>
411 additional gene annotations have been made by CryptoDB for the <i>C. parvum</i> genome. These correspond to the genes annotated in the Genbank record simply as "introns and exons likely".
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><b>PFam Predictions</b>
    <ul><li>
    interproscan was used to query <i>C. parvum</i> and <i>C. hominis</i> annotated proteins against the PFam component of <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/index.html">InterPro</a>. A query to find genes by PFam family name has been added and predicted domains are documented on the gene record pages.
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Gene Ontology Terms</b>
    <ul><li>
<a href="http://www.geneontology.org/">GO terms</a> were collected from the interproscan analysis and are available for gene searches and are documented on the gene record pages.
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><b>EC Numbers</b>
    <ul><li>
EC number annotations have been added. Sources of EC numbers include Genbank, KEGG and the metabolic pathway database CryptoCyc. Genes may be searched by EC number.
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Gene Orthologs</b>
  <ul>
  <li>
    <i>C. parvum</i> and <i>C. hominis</i> orthologs computed at <a     href="http://orthomcl.cbil.upenn.edu/">OrthoMCL DB</a> have been added to our database. </li>
    <li>We have added <a href="http://cryptodb.org/cryptodb/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=GeneQuestions.GenesByOrthologPattern&amp;go.x=12&amp;go.y=4&amp;go=go">query</a> to find <i>Cryptosporidium</i> genes that have a specified phyletic pattern, based on ortholog groups. </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Analysis for MRC-LMB's chromosome 6</b>
    <ul><li>
    <i>C. parvum</i> chromosome 6 completed by Bankier, et al., MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology has undergone our in-house analysis. This includes DNA and protein sequences searched against NCBI's non-redundant protein database and protein queries against the PFam database.
