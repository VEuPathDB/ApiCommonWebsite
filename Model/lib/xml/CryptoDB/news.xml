    <p><strong>We are pleased to announce the release of CryptoDB 40.<br>
    CryptoDB 40 represents a software and features release.</strong></p>
      
      <section>
      <h3><b>New features in CryptoDB 40</b></h3>
        <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
        <h4>New Sense/Antisense RNA seq search</h4>
         <ul>
           <li><a href="/a/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=InternalGeneDatasetQuestions.GenesByRNASeqEvidence">RNA Seq searches</a> &mdash; <br>
           A new Sense/Antisense search for exploring strand specific transcription is available for any strand specific RNA sequence data set.  
           For each gene, the search compares the fold change in sense reads to the fold change in antisense reads and returns genes that 
           have simultaneous changes in sense vs antisense expression between two samples. Versatile search parameters allow for choosing 
           the direction and magnitude of the change in sense and antisense transcripts.  The search result page lists genes and indicates 
           the paired Reference->Comparison samples that meet the criteria, and offers two graphs to help interpret 
           the search results (FPKM vs sample bar graph, antisense FC vs sense FC scatter plot)

         <h4>New Galaxy tool and workflow</h4>
         <ul>
           <li>Map Your Proteins to OrthoMCL Groups workflow &mdash; <br>
           EuPathDB Galaxy now includes a preconfigured workflow for mapping proteins to OrthoMCL groups. The workflow 
           uses BLAST and the OrthoMCL algorithm to assign your set of proteins to OrthoMCL groups.
           Access the  workflow from the EuPathDB Galaxy home page under 
           'Get started with pre-configured workflows'. The workflow employs three tools which can be accessed 
           separately in the EuPathDB Galaxy tools menu under EuPathDB OrthoMCL Tools. This workflow duplicates 
           and replaces the 'Assign your proteins to groups' function in the Tools menu of the 
           <a href="http://orthomcl.org/orthomcl/" target="_blank">OrthoMCL site</a>.
           For more information see this 
           <a href="/assets/MapProteinsOrthoMCL.pdf">OrthoMCL proteome upload tutorial</a>.

           <li>RNA-Seq to EuPathDB export tool &mdash; <br>
           EuPathDB Galaxy now includes a tool for exporting the results of your RNA seq analysis to any EuPathDB site. The tool transfers 
           bigwig and FPKM text files to your private My Data Sets page on EuPathDB. From the My Data Sets page the files 
           are available for GBrowse visualization and the Search Strategy system.
           For more information see this 
           <a href="/assets/GalaxyRNASeqExportTool.pdf">RNA Seq to EuPathDB export tool tutorial</a>.

           <li><a href="/a/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=InternalGeneDatasetQuestions.GenesByRNASeqEvidence">RNA Seq fold change searches</a> 
           now offer an <b>FPKM Floor</b> parameter for adjusting the FPKM value of low expressing genes. To avoid 
           misleading fold change values generated by dividing with very small numbers, we set very low FPKM values to a default <b>FPKM floor</b> which represents
           10 mapped reads. The new parameter offers a range of floor values for raising or lowering the expression threshold of the search 
           depending on the user's objectives. For more information use the parameter help (blue question mark icon) on the search page or read the 
           <a href="/assets/Fold_Change_Help.pdf">detailed RNA seq search help</a>.

             <li>Announcing the Beta release of EuPathDB Workspace, a private workspace that can interface 
         with EuPathDB Galaxy and allows for viewing and interrogating private data against data that is already 
         integrated into EuPathDB (public data). The first EuPathDB workspace tool, 'Bigwig files to EuPathDB' 
         exports bigwig files from EuPathDB Galaxy to EuPathDB. 
         The tool creates a EuPathDB Data Set which is managed from the My Data Sets page along with your other private data sets. 
         Each data set also receives a record page which lists all files that the data set contains, offers file management 
         functions and ports files to the genome browser for viewing.<br><br>

                now includes an GO Subset option for limiting the search to only GO Slim generic terms.
                </li>
            <li>GO Terms tables on gene pages now contain a 'GO Subset' column which identifies GO Slim generic terms.
                </li>
            <li>The GO enrichment analysis has an option for limiting the analysis to GO Slim terms. This will limit both 
                the background and the gene list of interest in the Fisher's exact test that determines enrichment.

        In the transcriptomics section of gene pages, expression graphs display FPKM or RPKM values determined from uniquely aligned 
        reads (those that align to one location only). The coverage section shows plots of unique reads aligned to the genome.  
        This may underrepresent abundance for genes that are duplicated, such as paralogs. Non-unique reads are only available 
        as GBrowse subtracks. To view non-unique reads from a gene page, open the Coverage section and click 'View in 
        genome browser' above the coverage plots. 
        (<a href="/cryptodb/images/FromCoverageNonuniqueReads.pdf">Tutorial document about viewing non-unique reads from a gene page</a>)
        
        <br><br>
        To view non-unique reads without navigating to the gene page, open GBrowse from the home page.  Use the Select Tracks 
        tab to turn on the data track of interest and the subtracks configuration tool to turn on the non-unique reads subtracks. 
        (<a href="/cryptodb/images/FromHomeNonuniqueReads.pdf">Tutorial document for viewing non-unique reads from the home page</a>)
        
        <br><br>
        In release 34, gene pages contain a message about non-unique reads, an accurate description of the y-axis and links to 
        tutorials on how to display non-unique reads.  Future releases will offer searches based on the non-unique reads and 
        their contribution to expression. 
        
        <br><br>
        For future releases, we are working to implement a graphic visualization that provides information about both unique and a non-unique reads.

    <h3>CryptoDB 29</h3>
           CryptoDB 29 represents extensive efforts to improve navigation and data accessibility 
           on record pages, provide consistent verbiage and data categories, and improve presentation of alternative transcripts. 
           All data were refreshed to the latest version and genome analyses were rerun.
           <ul>
            <li>Here is some help information to get you started with our new features.<br>
                 <a href="http://cryptodb.org/documents/genePageTutorialGUS4.pdf">Gene Page Improvements</a> <br>
                 <a href="http://cryptodb.org/documents/SearchCatsTutorial_3.pdf">Search Category Improvements</a> <br>
                 <a href="http://cryptodb.org/documents/ExploreTranscripts.pdf">Explore Transcripts in Search Results</a><br>
                 <!--Workspaces<br>-->
             </li><br>
             <li>Send Us Your Feedback!<br>We can polish our new features based on your valuable feedback. Please use the site 
             and <a href="http://cryptodb.org/cryptodb/app/contact-us">Contact Us</a> to tell us about your experience. 
              </li><br>
             <li>CryptoDB 28 is Still Available - <br><a href="http://r28.cryptodb.org/cryptodb//">CryptoDB 28</a> is available until we finalize our new features.</li><br>

      <h3>New Features</h3>
         
           <ul>
             <li>Data Categories - <br>Searches, data and GBrowse tracks are now categorized according to the 
             <a href="http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/EDAM?iri=http://edamontology.org/topic_3070">EMBRACE Data & Methods Ontology (EDAM)</a>. 
             This offers a controlled vocabulary and consistent data structure throughout the site. 
             </li><br>
             <li>Record Pages Redesigned - <br>Gene pages, and in-fact all our record pages, have a new structure. 
             Features include a new streamlined and uncluttered look, new navigation tools, and improved 
             tables with search functions for quickly finding and displaying the data you want. 
             </li><br>
             <li>Transcripts Represented on Gene Pages and Search Results - <br>Transcripts are graphically represented on 
             gene pages and listed in gene page tables when data can be 
             unambiguously assigned to a transcript. All search results now 
             contain a Transcript ID column.  The results of searches that query transcript-specific 
             data (e.g. Predicted Signal Peptide) contain an Explore function for investigating transcript subsets.
             </li><br>
             <li>Galaxy Workspace - <br> EuPathDB sites now include a Galaxy-based workspace for large-scale data analyses. 
             Developed in partnership with <a href="https://www.globus.org/genomics">Globus Genomics</a>, 
             workspaces offer a private analysis platform with published workflows and pre-loaded annotated genomes. 
             The workspace is accessed through the "Analyze My Experiment" tab on the home page of any EuPathDB resource 
             and can be used to upload your own data, compose and run custom workflows, retrieve results and share 
             workflows and data analyses with colleagues.
             </li><br>
             <li>Download Search Result Redesigned - <br>The page for downloading search results and associated data has 
             an improved design that reflects the new ontological data categories and offers the ability to download 
             all transcripts per gene when downloading gene results.
             </li><br>
             <li>RNA Sequencing Workflow - We updated our RNA sequencing analysis. The new workflow aligns 
             reads with GSNAP, calculates FPKM/RPKM from HT-Seq counts and determines differential expression with DESeq2.
             </li>
           </ul>
        </section>

            One way EuPathDB analyzes expression is to determine statistically significant differential gene expression using the  
            Fisher's exact test. This tutorial describes our Fold Change w/ P-value searches that return differentially 
            expressed genes based on the level of statistical confidence that you choose.

         <![CDATA[
<body>
    <p>Dear colleagues -<br>
      <br>
      We are writing to provide an update on the Eukaryotic Pathogen Genomics
      Resource (<a href="http://EuPathDB.org">EuPathDB.org</a>), which many
      hundreds of laboratories wrote to support in connection with our
      application for renewal as an NIH Bioinformatics Resource Center for
      Infectious Diseases.&nbsp; We are pleased to report that the EuPathDB
      contract has now been renewed.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to continuing to integrate the ever-increasing volume of
      Omic-scale datasets available for microbial eukaryotes, new
      functionalities anticipated over the coming months include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>full integration of FungiDB into the EuPathDB family of databases</li>
      <li>reorganization of EuPathDB record pages, so as to improve
        navigability, better accommodate curated annotation (when available),
        represent alternative transcripts, summarize functional genomic results,
        etc</li>
      <li>better representation of experimental metadata, including phenotyping
        and clinical/field results</li>
      <li>enhanced functionality of the host response database (<a href="http://HostDB.org">HostDB.org</a>)</li>
      <li>improved handling of metabolic pathways, including incorporation of
        metabolomic datasets</li>
      <li>better support for orthology-based queries and cross-species inference</li>
      <li>implementation of workspaces enabling users to upload and analyze
        their own data (e.g. RNA-seq results)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
      The scope of this renewal extends beyond our previous mandate, which
      officially covered only biosecurity threats (Cryptosporidium, Entamoeba,
      Giardia, Toxoplasma, etc) and reemerging pathogens (e.g.
      Plasmodium).&nbsp; This makes it easier for us to leverage EuPathDB
      infrastructure in support of the kinetoplastida, oomycetes, fungi, and
      other microbial eukaryotes, including both pathogenic and non-pathogenic
      species.<br>
      <br>
      The scale of the EuPathDB award from NIH does not provide adequate funding
      for full support of the TriTrypDB or FungiDB projects (unfortunately) ...
      but the Wellcome Trust has agreed to consider an application covering
      these initiatives, augmenting our existing award for kinetoplastid
      resources.&nbsp; We will be contacting users of these databases shortly
      for their support.<br>
      <br>
      As always, we look forward to feedback from database users, via the
      'Contact Us' link on all EuPathDB web sites, face-to-face discussions at
      major meetings, etc.<br>

    <p>We are pleased to announce the 9th annual EuPathDB workshop to be held in
      Athens, Georgia, USA from June 15 to Wednesday, June 18, 2014.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <br>
      <br>
      Please note that the workshop expenses, in addition to room and board
      costs are covered by EuPathDB (see cost and fees section below).&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Come learn how to effectively use EuPathDB resources and mine available
      data to help guide your research.<br>
      <br>
      For more information and to apply, please visit:
      http://workshop.eupathdb.org/current/<br>
      <br>
      The workshop will cover all of our component databases (EuPathDB,
      AmoebaDB, CryptoDB, GiardiaDB, MicrosporidiaDB, PlasmoDB, PiroplasmaDB,
      ToxoDB, TrichDB, TriTrypDB and OrthoMCL), and will run from 6:00PM (18:00)
      on Sunday, June 15 to 5:00PM (17:00) on Wednesday, June 18, 2014.<br>
      <br>
      The application deadline is February 28, 2014 and the course is limited to
      30 participants.<br>
      <br>
      <em><strong>Who should apply:</strong></em>&nbsp; This workshop is
      intended to be a 3 day thorough and intensive introduction to database
      resources that are part of the EuPathDB.org Bioinformatics Resource Center
      (EuPathDB, AmoebaDB, CryptoDB, GiardiaDB, MicrosporidiaDB, PlasmoDB,
      PiroplasmaDB, ToxoDB, TrichDB, TriTrypDB and OrthoMCL). The ideal
      candidate would have a need to become an expert user of one or more of
      these database resources and presumably has a bioinformatics research
      problem that they might work on as part of their training while attending
      the course. Preference will be given to applicants that are in a position
      to benefit most from intensive training and that are in a position to
      return to their home institution and transfer their newly acquired
      knowledge to others. Evaluation of the applications will focus heavily on
      your responses to the questions asked on the application page and on
      letters of recommendation.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <strong><em>Costs and Fees:</em> </strong>The course is free. Housing
      (double occupancy), all training materials and lunches are covered.
      Attendees are expected to provide their own transportation to the course
      and pay for a few of their meals. Letters of acceptance will be mailed
      early to facilitate the solicitation of outside travel funds.<br>
      <br>
      Hotel room charges for a shared room will be paid by EuPathDB for the
      nights of June 15 through June 18. Attendees who would like to have a
      private room will need to pay the difference of $47 per night plus
      tax.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      For more information and to apply, please visit:
      http://workshop.eupathdb.org/current/<br>

style="font-weight: bold;">We are pleased to announce the release of
CryptoDB 5.0</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><br>
This release of CryptoDB constitutes a complete rebuild of the
database.&nbsp; This means that all genomes and data were reloaded and
reanalyzed. As a result of community feedback, we have included strain
names with all <em>Cryptosporidium</em> species, and removed the
independently sequenced and annotated <em>C. parvum</em> chromosome 6
from CryptoDB searches. The <em>C. parvum</em> chromosome 6 sequence
and annotation is still available as a Genome Browser track.&nbsp; It
is possible that many of your stored search strategies will need to be
rerun to accommodate the new analyses (please see note at the bottom of
this news item).&nbsp; We encourage you to explore this release and, as
usual, we look forward to hearing from you with suggestions for further
improvement and any problems you may encounter.&nbsp; <br>

combine
steps based on relative locations on the genome.&nbsp; This enables
you, for
example, to return all genes that contain a specific DNA motif within
1000 nucleotides upstream of the annotated start site. Or you could
return all genes that have a SNP between two strains within 500
nucleotides of the start of the gene (or return all SNPs that are
located in this region relative to genes).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

Dear Cryptosporidium Researcher,<br><br>

We would like to inform you of a proposal being prepared on behalf of the research community to generate genomic and RNA-seq data for a number of Cryptosporidium species, including laboratory propagated and geographic/clinical isolates.  The proposal will be submitted for funding to the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) for consideration by the Eukaryotic Pathogen and Disease Vector Sequencing Project working group and coordinating committee.<br><br>
http://www.niaid.nih.gov/labsandresources/resources/gsc/pathogen/Pages/default.aspx
<br><br>
The species we are suggesting include <i>C. parvum</i>, <i>C. hominis</i>, <i>C. meleagridis</i>, <i>C. bovis</i>, <i>C. bailey</i>, <i>C. cuniculus</i> and <i>C. ubiquitum</i>. This sequencing effort will facilitate comparative analyses to identify genes which control host specificity and other clinically and biologically important traits, as well as to extend our understanding of Cryptosporidium populations. All data will be available to the public through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and CryptoDB.org websites.<br><br>

We would like to solicit your input and request your support.  At this time an e-mail expressing your interest in this project or proposing changes would be much appreciated. Please indicate whether you may have access to Cryptosporidium positive clinical or animal samples which could be made available for this project.<br><br>

Please send emails of inquiry and/or support to Giovanni Widmer (giovanni.widmer@tufts.edu)  or Jessie Kissinger (jkissing@uga.edu)

<b>We are pleased to report that the following Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) have been awarded in connection with the EuPathDB Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC):</b><br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>The Toxoplasma oocyst transcriptome and proteome</b><br>
   John Boothroyd, Matt Bogyo (Stanford) & Pat Conrad (UC Davis)<br>
   This project is expected to yield expression data from an important, but inaccessible, life cycle stage (1 yr). <br><br></li>
<li><b>A comprehensive catalog of the T. gondii & N. caninum parasite & infected host cell transcriptome & proteome</b><br>
   Brian Gregory (Univ. Pennsylvania) & Jonathan Wastling (Univ. Liverpool)<br>
   This project will produce an immense volume of sequence data, driving database improvements for handling 'next-gen' sequencing, non-coding RNAs, and interrogating host & pathogen datasets in parallel (2 yr).<br><br></li>

<li><b>Dissection of Plasmodium falciparum genetic crosses by mass spectrometry-based metabolite QTL</b><br>
   Manuel Llin&aacute;s (Princeton) & Michael Ferdig (Notre Dame)<br>
   This project is expected to improve handling of genetic mapping data, incorporation of metabolomics results (integrated with pathway maps), and linking of specific genetic loci with metabolite abundance (2 yr).<br><br></li>
</ul>

A biennial competition for DBP awards is mandated by the BRC contract from NIH/NIAID, and supported by a total of $1.2M in total costs per award cycle.  The goal of this program is to produce high value genomic-scale datasets for the EuPathDB user community, and drive the further development of bioinformatics resources for data analysis and mining.<br><br>

Letters of intent (LOI) were solicited in February (see Feb 4 News item), and reviewed by the EuPathDB Scientific Working Group (SWG; see News, March 31).  12 full applications were solicited from among the ~50 LOIs received, and awards were based on further scientific review by the SWG, and in consultation with NIAID program staff.  Cost negotiations and 'in kind' contributions from other sources made it possible to support 3 applications, from 6 investigators (in some cases, more than one LOI was merged into a single award).<br><br>

We received far more high quality proposals than could be supported, testifying to the need for such mechanisms for data production bioinformatics analysis.  The EuPathDB team looks forward to working with members of our user community who are seeking funding for such projects from external sources.  Inquiries, including requests for support letters, should be directed to the EuPathDB staff (click on the 'Contact Us' link).<br><br>

<b>A new solicitation for DBPs is anticipated in 2011, and will be announced on the EuPathDB web site.</b>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">We are pleased to
announce new features in CryptoDB 4.3<br>
<br>
<br>
In an effort to continue improving the utility of CryptoDB, we have
implemented several new features in recent releases. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
</span>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"My
Basket"</span> allows one to cherry pick genes and add them to
the basket for subsequent conversion into a step in a strategy.
&nbsp;The basket is accessible from the gray menu bar and the
number of items in your basket is indicated.</li>
  <br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Weighted
searches</span>&nbsp;allows you to assign an arbitrary weight
to the searches (steps) in
your search strategy making it possible for you to view a ranked list
of your results. &nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Here is an example of the
same strategy looking for putative secreted enzymes in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">C. parvum</span>
sporozoites, once
without weighting and then with weighting. &nbsp;Notice that you
have a larger number of results with weighting and those can be sorted
based on the sum of the weights, giving a ranked list of results.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://cryptodb.org/cryptodb/im.do?s=cc6f953ad316300c">Putative
secreted enzymes (unweighted)</a><br>
<br>
<a href="http://cryptodb.org/cryptodb/im.do?s=a00564ffb60fe09b">Putative
secreted enzymes (Weighted)</a><br>
</div>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"My
Favorites"</span> allows you to bookmark and organize genes you
access frequently. &nbsp;A tutorial on how to use this feature is
available <a
 href="http://eupathdb.org/tutorials/Favorites/favorites_viewlet_swf.html">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Feature evaluators still needed:<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">We welcome you to *sign
up* to be an early evaluator of new features on the EuPathDB sites.
This will be an opportunity for you to help us refine and improve
features early in the development process.&nbsp;In fact, the "My
Favorites" feature was the subject of our first survey and feature
evaluator's comments and suggestions contributed to enhancing this
feature. <br>
<br>
Signing on is easy and will
require minimal effort on your part in the form of answering questions
or rendering your opinion. &nbsp;<br>

        <li> Improved result summary pages that also include results filtered against all <i>Cryptosporidium</i> in CryptoDB.</li>
        <li> A dramatically revamped isolate query section.  In particular, this includes a vastly improved organization of isolates to allow more useful queries.  Our Geographic location query now includes a map to allow visualization of isolate location by country or continent.</li>
        <li> Blast can now be performed against reference isolates only which should facilitate typing.</li>
        <li>  Reference RFLP gel images are now made available via CryptoDB (a link from the isolate section).</li>
        <li>  We now provide a phylogenetic tree view of multiple sequence alignments from isolate sequence that you choose.</li>
        <li>  Several additional queries have been implemented including queries for secondary structure (based on sequences in the Protein Data Bank or PSIPRED), isoelectric point and available antibodies (in the reagents section). </li>
        </ul>
        *We are grateful to several investigators who have provided data and advice for this release of CryptoDB including:

         A preliminary assembly of <i>C. muris</i> was obtained at approximately 
         4.5 X coverage, and
reveals a ~9Mb genome with average cytosine-guanine content (%GC) of ~28.5
%. This assembly is based on ~50,000 reads obtained mostly from a
small-insert library and a fosmid library. This assembly is estimated to
contain ~ 92% of the ~9Mb genome, and consists of 927 contigs arranged into
595 scaffolds.
<p>
Final assembly, to be released in late summer, will include an additional 2X
coverage obtained from a medium insert library and possibly >5X additional
coverage obtained with 454 pyrosequencing technology. The final assembly is
expected to contain > 99% of the genome.
<p>
Sequencing from the cDNA library provided by Giovanni Widmer is underway.
Average insert length is 1,600 bp. If the library is shown to be random, an
expected >30,000 EST reads will be obtained.
<p>
More information is 
available on the project's website

         New data and queries in CryptoDB 3.5:
<ul>
<li>Proteomics data provided by two labs (Wastling, et al. (updated from CryptoDB 3.4) and Snelling, et al. (new data)) have been loaded, and 
these are visible on the Genome Sequence Browser. Queries to find genes, or ORFs, that show evidence of protein expression based on Mass Spec analyses are also available.</li>
<li><i>C. muris</i> contigs from first draft assembly and translated open reading frames.</li>
<li>Interproscan analysis of <i>Cryptosporidium</i> proteins.</li>
</ul>
<p>
New features in CryptoDB 3.5:
<ul>
<li>We have added <a href="http://cryptodb.org/cryptodb/showXmlDataContent.do?name=XmlQuestions.Tutorials">tutorial movies</a> to help you learn about the functionality of our site. 
If there are additional tutorials you would like to see added please submit a request via our <a href="http://cryptodb.org/cryptodb/app/contact-us" class="new-window" data-name="contact_us">support page</a>.</li>
<li>Most of the queries have been reorganized to make them more intuitive. Some include a new "Advanced Parameters" section. See for example "Identify Genes based on EST evidence."
<li>The columns displayed in query result pages are improved.  The result pages also offer options for sorting, adding new columns, and moving columns around.
<li>Downloading results is improved. A choice of formats is provided including tab-delimited, text, GFF, and FASTA to meet different needs.
  <ul>
  <li>Tab delimited provides an expanded list of annotations that can be directly exported as an Excel spreadsheet.
  <li>Text provides a detailed summary for each gene including protein structures, notes, sequence, and many other choices.
  <li> GFF is a format recognized by many applications such as the genome browser, gbrowse.
  <li> FASTA also provides a common format used for BLAST and other applications. The FASTA option provides the functionality of the SRT (sequence retrieval tool).
  </ul>

The <b><i>Cryptosporidium muris</i> genome sequencing project</b> has been funded by the
National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases (NIAID), through the
Microbial Sequencing Center program at the Institute for Genomic Research
(TIGR). This project aims at obtaining a high-quality assembly of <i>C. muris</i>
genome based on 8X sequence coverage, as well as the comparative automated
and manual curation of gene structure predictions of all three
<i>Cryptosporidium</i> genomes sequenced to date. More information is 
available on the project's website
(<a href="http://msc.tigr.org/c_muris/index.shtml">http://msc.tigr.org/c_muris/index.shtml</a>).
All sequence reads and traces will be deposited with GenBank and the genome
assemblies and annotations will be deposited with GenBank and CryptoDB.
