Giardia lamblia is a significant, environmentally transmitted,
human pathogen and an amitochondriate protist. It is a major
contributor to the enormous worldwide burden of human diarrheal
diseases, yet the basic biology of this parasite is not well
understood. No virulence factor has been identified. The Giardia
lamblia genome contains only 12 million base pairs distributed
onto five chromosomes. Its analysis promises to provide insights
about the origins of nuclear genome organization, the metabolic
pathways used by parasitic protists, and the cellular biology of
host interaction and avoidance of host immune systems.

<br><br>

Since the divergence of Giardia lamblia lies close to the
transition between eukaryotes and prokaryotes in universal
ribosomal RNA phylogenies, it is a valuable, if not unique, model
for gaining basic insights into genetic innovations that led to
formation of eukaryotic cells. In evolutionary terms, the
divergence of this organism is at least twice as ancient as the
common ancestor for yeast and man. A detailed study of its genome
will provide insights into an early evolutionary stage of
eukaryotic chromosome organization as well as other aspects of
the prokaryotic / eukaryotic divergence.

Genes were predicted using the computer programs CRITICA (1) and
GLIMMER (2, 3) using a training set of published giardial genes
from GenBank. The two programs collectively predicted 9,663
protein-coding genes after removal of predictions lacking proper
start and stop codons. Where alternate start codons were possible
for gene calls, the longest prediction was retained, including
overlapping predictions on alternate reading frames. Each gene
prediction was evaluated using independent statistical measures:
TestCode (4), GeneScan (5) and the Codon Adaptation Index (6).
Threshold scores were TestCode value of >4, GeneScan score of
>9.7, or an in-frame codon usage score greater than the two
out-of- frame scores (7). 
<br><br> 
In release 1.0, predictions
were classified as genes if they had (1) similarity to known
proteins at e-10 or better (2,370 predictions), (2) weak or no
similarity, but transcriptional or proteomic evidence (2,753
predictions), or (3) no similarity or expression evidence, but
high scores on two or more metrics (1,347 predictions), whether
or not they exhibited similarity to known proteins or motifs. The
very small number of recognized introns (4, to date) means that
the start and stop of the gene model are identical to the
corresponding ORF. 
<br><br>
In release 1.1, we evaluated the
degree and direction of overlap between genes and demoted many
(1,611) to "deprecated genes".  Most of the deprecated genes are
short and have no known function.
