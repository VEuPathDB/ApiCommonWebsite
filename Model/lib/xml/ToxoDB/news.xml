ToxoDB 4.2 provides microarray expression data and mass-spec data, and queries against them. The Genome Browser has new tracks for the proteomics data, and cosmid and BAC ends. 
<p>
The ToxoDB 4.2 web site also has significant improvements to the query and results pages. Many of the queries have been reorganized. For example, the SNPs based on Gene ID query now allows an input of a list of genes, either put in by hand or uploaded from a file. The results from this and all other queries can be sorted on various columns. It is also now possible to add columns of interest (e.g., protein features, GO annotation, even expression characteristics for gene results) and sort on them.
<p>
New data and queries in ToxoDB 4.2:
<ul>
<li>Two expression experiments carried out on the Toxo Affymetrix array, namely:
  <ul>
  <li> Effects of Glucose Starvation in Toxoplasma gondii 
  <li> Expression profiling of the 3 archetypal T. gondii lineages
  </ul>
 have been added to the ToxoDB Database, and queries are provided to find genes by differential expression and by percentile of expression.

<li> Proteomics data provided by two labs (Wastling and Murray) have been loaded, and these are visible on the Genome Sequence Browser. Queries to find genes, or ORFs, that show evidence of protein expression based on Mass Spec analyses are also available.
<li>BAC ends and cosmid ends sequences have been loaded, and can be viewed in the Genome Sequence Browser
<li>A mapping of epitopes to <i>Toxoplasma</i> provided by the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) <http://www.immuneepitope.org/home.do>. A query is now provided to identify genes whose encoding protein has an epitope at different levels of confidence.
<li>Updated E.C. number and metabolic pathway assignments, Interpro protein domains and associated GO predictions, 
<li>A new build of ortholog groups from Orthomcl for use in ToxoDB. The list of genomes represented has increased from 55 to 87  and includes all the organisms covered by the different NIH/NIAID funded Bioinformatics Resource Centers.
<li>ToxoCyc, a database of computationally predicted metabolic pathways for <i>Toxplasma</i>, is available online and is cross-referenced on the gene pages of ToxoDB.
</ul>
<p>
New features in ToxoDB 4.2:
<ul>
<li>Most of the queries have been reorganized to make them more intuitive. Some include a new "Advanced Parameters" section. See for example "Identify Genes based on EST evidence."
<li>The columns displayed in query result pages are improved.  The result pages also offer options for sorting, adding new columns, and moving columns around.
<li>Downloading results is improved. A choice of formats is provided including tab-delimited, text, GFF, and FASTA to meet different needs.
  <ul>
  <li>Tab delimited provides an expanded list of annotations that can be directly exported as an Excel spreadsheet.
  <li>Text provides a detailed summary for each gene including SNPs, metabolic pathways, notes, sequence, and many other choices.
  <li> GFF is a format recognized by many applications such as the genome browser, gbrowse.
  <li> FASTA also provides a common format used for BLAST and other applications. The FASTA option provides the functionality of the SRT (sequence retrieval tool).
  </ul>
<li> As per request, we have provided for Blast against GT1, VEG and RH (Chr Ia, Ib) genome sequences, in addition to the reference ME49 genome.

 We are pleased to announce Version 4.0 of the Toxoplasma Genome Database. 

<p>ToxoDB provides access to the genome sequence and annotation of the apicomplexan parasite <i>T. gondii</i> &nbsp; (ME49 strain). We have also incorporated into this release the genomic sequence of <i>T. gondii</i> GT1 strain, provided by The Institute for Genome Research (TIGR). 
<!--As a result, we have focused on providing access to ... through the ToxoDB 4.0 site but have not completely reproduced all the functions in ToxoDB 3.0. Therefore we have kept the ToxoDB 3.0 site fully active for continued use. -->
<p>
ToxoDB 4.0 includes:
<ul>
<li>A new interactive genome browser, based on the GBrowse module of the GMOD project, providing rapid visualization of the parasite genome and gene models, custom restriction site identification, open reading frame identification, and downloads in various formats.
<li>The genome sequence for T. gondii GT1 strain (from TIGR).
<li><i>T. gondii</i> ME49 strain annotation, including manual annotation from Toxoplasma Genome Sequencing Project; updated GO term curation.
<li>TIGR Gene Indices for <i>T. gondii</i>.
<li>New ortholog analyses, using the OrthoMCL algorithm to group genes from <i>T. gondii</i> with other complete eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes (Chen et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 34:D363; 2006).
</ul>
</p>
<p>The release represents a complete restructuring of this database resource. 
We have eliminated the practice of using flat files as a means of data storage, upgraded to use the Genomics Unified Schema (GUS) database system and populated an underlying Oracle database in a systematic fashion. 
Additionally, we have employed the new Web Development Kit (WDK), dramatically changing the way the web site operates under the hood. 
This transformation conforms to the model used by all <a href="http://www.apidb.org">ApiDB</a> projects; it will henceforth not only make it easier to generate future releases in short cycles, but these changes also ensure a consistent look and feel for all ApiDB projects, namely ToxoDB, <a href="http://www.cryptodb.org">CryptoDB</a>, and <a href="http://www.plasmodb.org">PlasmoDB</a> (supported by a Bioinformatics Resource Center contract from the US NIH / NIAID).</p>
<p>Further, note that not only can the users ask questions (by issuing queries), but the website also provides the improved functionality of combining queries together and/or downloading the results in a customizable manner.</p>

OrthoMCL is an algorithm developed to identify orthologs and recent paralogs based on whole genome comparison of protein sequences (Li et al Genome Res. 13:2178; 2003). Previously, OrthoMCL groups were based on comparison of only 16 species in ToxoDB 3.3. In the current release, OrthoMCL groups were generated with 61 species. These species include the 55 used to generate orthologs groups at the <a href="http://orthomcl.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/OrthoMclWeb.cgi">OrthoMCL DB site</a> plus <i>P. vivax, Leishmania major, T. brucei, T. cruzi, Apis mellifera</i> (honeybee) and <i>S. purpatus</i> (sea urchin).
