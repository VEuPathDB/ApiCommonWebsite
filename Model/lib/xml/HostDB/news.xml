            <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
      
      <h4>Search Page Improvements: search pages were redesigned to include an organism filter and provide better access to help information.</h4>
      
          <ul>
            <li>Search parameters are now left justified. The Get Answer button remains center justified below the parameters. Parameter help 
                icons, which offer information concerning the parameters when hovered over, now appear before the parameter name instead of after.
                </li>
            <li>The Organism Parameter, the first parameter on search pages, has a new look and now contains a filter box for quickly finding 
                your organism of interest.  Type any portion of an organism name (at leaset two letters of the genus, species, or strain) 
                in the filter box and the tree collapses to show 
                only those organisms containing your entry.  To return to the full tree, click the X in the filter box.  
                </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>New Paralog Count search</h4>
      
          <ul>
            <li>The new 
                <a href="/a/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=GeneQuestions.GenesByParalogCount">Paralog Count search</a>
                returns genes based on the number of assigned paralogs. Find genes that have a number of paralogs within the specified range. 
                Paralogs are defined as genes from the same species that belong to the same OrthoMCL group.
                </li>
            <li>Find the search under the Orthology and Synteny category.
                </li>
          </ul>
       
       <h4>Gene Record Page Improvements:</h4>
 
          <ul>
            <li>A new GO Slim table now appears above the GO Term table on the record pages of genes with GO associated data. 
                The GO Slim table maps GO Terms form the GO Term table to their GO Slim terms based on the 
                <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/page/go-slim-and-subset-guide" target="_blank">Generic GO slim developed by GO Consortium</a>.
                </li>
            <li>Column headers in gene page tables now show a help icon (
                <img src="/a/images/HelpIcon.png"  height="15px" width="16px">)
                when additional information or definitions are available 
                for the column. Hover over the help icons to reveal additional information.  
                </li>
            <li>Metabolic pathway and reaction tables on gene pages now include reaction compound names, with CHEBI IDs on mouse over, 
                and a column that indicates if the EC number associated with a gene is an exact match to the EC number in metabolic pathway.   
                </li>
          </ul>

        
        <h4>Search Strategy Improvement: new option for combining steps in a search strategy. </h4>
       
          <ul>
            <li>Search strategies now offer an option to 'ignore' a step when editing a multi-step strategy. To remove a search 
                from the strategy without deleting the step, click Edit for the combine graphic of the step you are interested in ignoring. 
                Then choose 'IGNORE step #' from the Revise Operation popup. For more information see this 
                <a href="/a/images/ignoreStep.jpg">Ignore Step help document</a>.

        In the transcriptomics section of gene pages, expression graphs display FPKM or RPKM values determined from uniquely aligned 
        reads (those that align to one location only). The coverage section shows plots of unique reads aligned to the genome.  
        This may underrepresent abundance for genes that are duplicated, such as paralogs. Non-unique reads are only available 
        as GBrowse subtracks. To view non-unique reads from a gene page, open the Coverage section and click 'View in 
        genome browser' above the coverage plots. 
        (<a href="/hostdb/images/FromCoverageNonuniqueReads.pdf">Tutorial document about viewing non-unique reads from a gene page</a>)
        
        <br><br>
        To view non-unique reads without navigating to the gene page, open GBrowse from the home page.  Use the Select Tracks 
        tab to turn on the data track of interest and the subtracks configuration tool to turn on the non-unique reads subtracks. 
        (<a href="/hostdb/images/FromHomeNonuniqueReads.pdf">Tutorial document for viewing non-unique reads from the home page</a>)
        
        <br><br>
        In release 34, gene pages contain a message about non-unique reads, an accurate description of the y-axis and links to 
        tutorials on how to display non-unique reads.  Future releases will offer searches based on the non-unique reads and 
        their contribution to expression. 
        
        <br><br>
        For future releases, we are working to implement a graphic visualization that provides information about both unique and a non-unique reads.

           Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct old data when necessary.
           Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
           When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ø) the search and ask you to rerun it.
           When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.

      <h3>New Features</h3>
         
           <ul>
             <li>Data Categories - <br>Searches, data and GBrowse tracks are now categorized according to the 
             <a href="http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/EDAM?iri=http://edamontology.org/topic_3070">EMBRACE Data & Methods Ontology (EDAM)</a>. 
             This offers a controlled vocabulary and consistent data structure throughout the site. 
             </li><br>
             <li>Record Pages Redesigned - <br>Gene pages, and in-fact all our record pages, have a new structure. 
             Features include a new streamlined and uncluttered look, new navigation tools, and improved 
             tables with search functions for quickly finding and displaying the data you want. 
             </li><br>
             <li>Transcripts Represented on Gene Pages and Search Results - <br>Transcripts are graphically represented on 
             gene pages and listed in gene page tables when data can be 
             unambiguously assigned to a transcript. All search results now 
             contain a Transcript ID column.  The results of searches that query transcript-specific 
             data (e.g. Predicted Signal Peptide) contain an Explore function for investigating transcript subsets.
             </li><br>
             <li>Galaxy Workspace - <br> EuPathDB sites now include a Galaxy-based workspace for large-scale data analyses. 
             Developed in partnership with <a href="https://www.globus.org/genomics">Globus Genomics</a>, 
             workspaces offer a private analysis platform with published workflows and pre-loaded annotated genomes. 
             The workspace is accessed through the "Analyze My Experiment" tab on the home page of any EuPathDB resource 
             and can be used to upload your own data, compose and run custom workflows, retrieve results and share 
             workflows and data analyses with colleagues.
             </li><br>
             <li>Download Search Result Redesigned - <br>The page for downloading search results and associated data has 
             an improved design that reflects the new ontological data categories and offers the ability to download 
             all transcripts per gene when downloading gene results.
             </li><br>
             <li>RNA Sequencing Workflow - We updated our RNA sequencing analysis. The new workflow aligns 
             reads with GSNAP, calculates FPKM/RPKM from HT-Seq counts and determines differential expression with DESeq2.
             </li>

        Note: Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct old data when necessary.
        Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
        When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ø) the search and ask you to rerun it.
        When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.

    <p>Dear colleagues -<br>
      <br>
      We are writing to provide an update on the Eukaryotic Pathogen Genomics
      Resource (<a href="http://EuPathDB.org">EuPathDB.org</a>), which many
      hundreds of laboratories wrote to support in connection with our
      application for renewal as an NIH Bioinformatics Resource Center for
      Infectious Diseases.&nbsp; We are pleased to report that the EuPathDB
      contract has now been renewed.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to continuing to integrate the ever-increasing volume of
      Omic-scale datasets available for microbial eukaryotes, new
      functionalities anticipated over the coming months include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>full integration of FungiDB into the EuPathDB family of databases</li>
      <li>reorganization of EuPathDB record pages, so as to improve
        navigability, better accommodate curated annotation (when available),
        represent alternative transcripts, summarize functional genomic results,
        etc</li>
      <li>better representation of experimental metadata, including phenotyping
        and clinical/field results</li>
      <li>enhanced functionality of the host response database (<a href="http://HostDB.org">HostDB.org</a>)</li>
      <li>improved handling of metabolic pathways, including incorporation of
        metabolomic datasets</li>
      <li>better support for orthology-based queries and cross-species inference</li>
      <li>implementation of workspaces enabling users to upload and analyze
        their own data (e.g. RNA-seq results)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
      The scope of this renewal extends beyond our previous mandate, which
      officially covered only biosecurity threats (Cryptosporidium, Entamoeba,
      Giardia, Toxoplasma, etc) and reemerging pathogens (e.g.
      Plasmodium).&nbsp; This makes it easier for us to leverage EuPathDB
      infrastructure in support of the kinetoplastida, oomycetes, fungi, and
      other microbial eukaryotes, including both pathogenic and non-pathogenic
      species.<br>
      <br>
      The scale of the EuPathDB award from NIH does not provide adequate funding
      for full support of the TriTrypDB or FungiDB projects (unfortunately) ...
      but the Wellcome Trust has agreed to consider an application covering
      these initiatives, augmenting our existing award for kinetoplastid
      resources.&nbsp; We will be contacting users of these databases shortly
      for their support.<br>
      <br>
      As always, we look forward to feedback from database users, via the
      'Contact Us' link on all EuPathDB web sites, face-to-face discussions at
      major meetings, etc.<br>

 <body>
    <p>We are pleased to announce the 9th annual EuPathDB workshop to be held in
      Athens, Georgia, USA from June 15 to Wednesday, June 18, 2014.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <br>
      <br>
      Please note that the workshop expenses, in addition to room and board
      costs are covered by EuPathDB (see cost and fees section below).&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Come learn how to effectively use EuPathDB resources and mine available
      data to help guide your research.<br>
      <br>
      For more information and to apply, please visit:
      http://workshop.eupathdb.org/current/<br>
      <br>
      The workshop will cover all of our component databases (EuPathDB,
      AmoebaDB, CryptoDB, GiardiaDB, MicrosporidiaDB, PlasmoDB, PiroplasmaDB,
      ToxoDB, TrichDB, TriTrypDB and OrthoMCL), and will run from 6:00PM (18:00)
      on Sunday, June 15 to 5:00PM (17:00) on Wednesday, June 18, 2014.<br>
      <br>
      The application deadline is February 28, 2014 and the course is limited to
      30 participants.<br>
      <br>
      <em><strong>Who should apply:</strong></em>&nbsp; This workshop is
      intended to be a 3 day thorough and intensive introduction to database
      resources that are part of the EuPathDB.org Bioinformatics Resource Center
      (EuPathDB, AmoebaDB, CryptoDB, GiardiaDB, MicrosporidiaDB, PlasmoDB,
      PiroplasmaDB, ToxoDB, TrichDB, TriTrypDB and OrthoMCL). The ideal
      candidate would have a need to become an expert user of one or more of
      these database resources and presumably has a bioinformatics research
      problem that they might work on as part of their training while attending
      the course. Preference will be given to applicants that are in a position
      to benefit most from intensive training and that are in a position to
      return to their home institution and transfer their newly acquired
      knowledge to others. Evaluation of the applications will focus heavily on
      your responses to the questions asked on the application page and on
      letters of recommendation.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <strong><em>Costs and Fees:</em> </strong>The course is free. Housing

    <p align="justify">We are pleased to announce the 8th annual EuPathDB
      workshop to be held in Athens, Georgia, USA from June 2-5, 2013.   <br />
      <br />
      Please note that the workshop expenses, in addition to room and board
      costs are covered by EuPathDB (see cost and fees section below).  <br />
      <br />
      Come learn how to effectively use EuPathDB resources and mine available
      data to help guide your research.<br />
      <br />
      <b><a href="http://workshop.eupathdb.org/current/">For more information
          and to apply, please visit: http://workshop.eupathdb.org/current/</a></b><br />
      <br />
      The workshop will cover all of our component databases (EuPathDB,
      AmoebaDB, CryptoDB, GiardiaDB, MicrosporidiaDB, PlasmoDB, PiroplasmaDB,
      ToxoDB, TrichDB, TriTrypDB and OrthoMCL), and will run from 6:00PM (18:00)
      on Sunday, June 2 to 5:00PM (17:00) on Wednesday, June 5, 2013.<br />
      <br />
      The application deadline is February 18, 2013 and the course is limited to
      30 participants.<br />
      <br />
      Who should apply:  This workshop is intended to be a 3 day thorough and
      intensive introduction to database resources that are part of the
      EuPathDB.org Bioinformatics Resource Center (EuPathDB, AmoebaDB, CryptoDB,
      GiardiaDB, MicrosporidiaDB, PlasmoDB, PiroplasmaDB, ToxoDB, TrichDB,
      TriTrypDB and OrthoMCL). The ideal candidate would have a need to become
      an expert user of one or more of these database resources and presumably
      has a bioinformatics research problem that they might work on as part of
      their training while attending the course. Preference will be given to
      applicants that are in a position to benefit most from intensive training
      and that are in a position to return to their home institution and
      transfer their newly acquired knowledge to others. Evaluation of the
      applications will focus heavily on your responses to the questions asked
      on the application page and on letters of recommendation.<br />
      <br />
      Costs and Fees: The course is free. Housing, all training materials and
      most meals are covered. Attendees are expected to provide their own
      transportation to the course and pay for a few of their meals. No travel
      funds are available. Letters of acceptance will be mailed early to
      facilitate the solicitation of outside travel funds. Hotel room charges
      will be paid by EuPathDB from June 2 through 11:00am June 6 (Note: course
      ends at 5PM on June 5). Participants traveling from abroad may be able to
      arrive a day early or stay a day late as needed to accommodate travel
      arrangements.<br />
