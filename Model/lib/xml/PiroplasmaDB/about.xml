EuPathDB databases rely heavily on community input.  Each project in EuPathDB benefits from the advice and mentoring of members from each specific community. 
We hold monthly organism calls for each of our databases with members of the scientific advisory teams and others from the community.  
Anyone interested in joining one of these conference calls is encouraged to contact us.  
<!-- While monthly conference calls for PiroplasmaDB are already underway, 
a specific scientific advisory team as not yet been assembled.-->
