SchistoDB is an integrated genomic and functional genomic database for the genus Schistosoma, digenetic blood trematodes which cause human and animal diseases, named Schistosomiasis. The three main species infecting humans, Schistosoma japonicum, S. mansoni, S. haematobium, are collected in this SchistoDB database. SchistoDB integrates whole genome sequence and annotation along with experimental data and environmental isolate sequences provided by community researchers. The database includes supplemental bioinformatics analyses and a web interface for data-mining.

<br><br>

Schistosomes are atypical trematodes in that the adult stages have two sexes (dioecious) and are located in blood vessels of the definitive host. Most other trematodes are hermaphroditic and are found in the intestinal tract or in organs, such as the liver. The lifecycle of schistosomes includes two hosts: a definitive host (i.e. human) where the parasite undergoes sexual reproduction, and a single intermediate snail host where there are a number of asexual reproductive stages.

<br><br>

Geographic Distribution:
<br><br>
Schistosoma mansoni is found in parts of South America and the Caribbean, Africa, and the Middle East; S. haematobium in Africa and the Middle East; and S. japonicum in the Far East.

Genes were predicted using the computer programs CRITICA (1) and
GLIMMER (2, 3) using a training set of published giardial genes
from GenBank. The two programs collectively predicted 9,663
protein-coding genes after removal of predictions lacking proper
start and stop codons. Where alternate start codons were possible
for gene calls, the longest prediction was retained, including
overlapping predictions on alternate reading frames. Each gene
prediction was evaluated using independent statistical measures:
TestCode (4), GeneScan (5) and the Codon Adaptation Index (6).
Threshold scores were TestCode value of >4, GeneScan score of
>9.7, or an in-frame codon usage score greater than the two
out-of- frame scores (7). 
<br><br> 
In release 1.0, predictions
were classified as genes if they had (1) similarity to known
proteins at e-10 or better (2,370 predictions), (2) weak or no
similarity, but transcriptional or proteomic evidence (2,753
predictions), or (3) no similarity or expression evidence, but
high scores on two or more metrics (1,347 predictions), whether
or not they exhibited similarity to known proteins or motifs. The
very small number of recognized introns (4, to date) means that
the start and stop of the gene model are identical to the
corresponding ORF. 
<br><br>
In release 1.1, we evaluated the
degree and direction of overlap between genes and demoted many
(1,611) to "deprecated genes".  Most of the deprecated genes are
short and have no known function.
