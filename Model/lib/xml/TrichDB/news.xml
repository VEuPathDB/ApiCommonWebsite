We are pleased to announce the implementation&nbsp;a new tool in
TrichDB. &nbsp;The "My
Basket" tool allows you to select various genes from
your searches and add them to your basket (much like a shopping cart).
&nbsp;To add genes to your basket simply click on the basket icon
in a
result list or on a gene page. &nbsp;A green basket icon indicates
that a

basket to
a strategy to save it and perform additional searches or combine it
with one of your already existing strategies.
&nbsp;Please note that using the basket feature requires you to

We are pleased to announce a workshop taught as part of a collaboration between the Pathogen Genomics Group 
(Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK), the Eukaryotic Pathogen Bioinformatics Resource Center 
(University of Georgia and University of Pennsylvania, US), and the Seattle Biomedical Research Institute (US). 
This residential workshop aims to provide experimental biologists with hands-on experience in 
genomic-scale data analysis, including genome browsers and comparison tools, methods for 
data integration, and resources for sophisticated data mining.
Many examples and exercises will be drawn from the kinetoplastida, including <i>Leishmania spp.</i>, 
<i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, and <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>, although applicants working on other protozoan 
parasites will also benefit.<br><br>

We are pleased to announce the release of TrichDB 1.1
<p>
This release features a new user interface with added functionality and a graphical strategy system for building complex searches.
<p>
The new user interface contains many new features including:
<ul>
<li>  A new search strategy interface that enables users to more easily construct complex searches.
<li>  'User Comments' have been updated to enable submission of supporting evidence including pubmed identifiers and images (or other files). Comments may be added to any gene or sequence page, enhancing available annotation. 
<li>  Files can now be uploaded and provided to the community via the file repository section.
</ul>

an award from the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org">Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</a> in support of a
TrypDB component of the <a href="http://eupathdb.org/">EuPathDB</a> family of databases,
encompassing <i>Leishmania</i> species, <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, and

         <![CDATA[

We are pleased to announce the release of TrichDB  (<a href="/">http://www.trichdb.org</a> )  a new Web resource for interrogating the Trichomonas vaginalis genome, which was sequenced and annotated at The Institute for Genomics Research and published in Science magazine in early 2007.
<br><br>
TrichDB is modeled after the ApiDB family of apicomplexan genome database query sites (<a href="http://apidb.org">http://www.apiddb.org</a>).  Like those sites, TrichDB offers researchers a plethora of  tools for genomic data mining.  In addition to BLAST and pattern/motif similarity searches, users can identify T. vaginalis genes by genomic position; common name or keyword; gene attributes such as gene type and exon number; transcript expression evidence (ESTs including prepublication ESTs kindly provided by Dr. Petrus Tang and collaborators); physical characteristics of predicted proteins such as molecular weight and secondary structure;  predicted function from Gene Ontology and EC enzyme number annotation;  and cellular location.  Along with these tools for gene analysis there are also identification tools for ESTs and ORFs. A special feature of TrichDB is the ability to separately query repeat genes, which constitute a large fraction of the T. vaginalis genome.
<br><br>
TrichDB couples a comprehensive set of querying tools with extensively hyperlinked and highly-configurable displays of results. Numerous evidence types and data associated with a gene, including gene context, predicted protein, EST and BLAST alignments, and %GC content, can be displayed in a single graphic.  Users can choose just which elements to show in a display, allowing them to generate purpose-built images for presentation.
<br><br>
Finally, TrichDB is also a repository for T. vaginalis genome statistics, data and methods source links, links to other Trichmonas community web sites,  and daily updates of Trichomonas publications and genes deposited in Pubmed/Entrez.  New users can learn to use the TrichDB/ApiDB sites via a set of online tutorials linked from the TrichDB front page.
<br><br>
We hope you will take time to explore TrichDB. Please use the link found at the bottom of every TrichDB page to send us feedback  (<a href="/giardiadb/help.jsp"  target="_blank" onClick="poptastic(this.href); return false;">Contact Us!</a>).  We look forward to hearing from you!
<br><br>
Best regards,
<br>
The TrichDB Team
