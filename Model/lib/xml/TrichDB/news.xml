         <h4>Beta EuPathDB Workspace</h4>
         <ul>
             <li>Announcing the Beta release of EuPathDB Workspace, a private workspace that can interface 
         with EuPathDB Galaxy and allows for viewing and interrogating private data against data that is already 
         integrated into EuPathDB (public data). The first EuPathDB workspace tool, 'Bigwig files to EuPathDB' 
         exports bigwig files from EuPathDB Galaxy to EuPathDB. 
         The tool creates a EuPathDB Data Set which is managed from the My Data Sets page along with your other private data sets. 
         Each data set also receives a record page which lists all files that the data set contains, offers file management 
         functions and ports files to the genome browser for viewing.<br><br>

         <h4>Pathway Improvements</h4>
         <ul>
             <li>
               Semantic zooming of Pathway drawings on Pathway record pages - At low zoom levels, pathway nodes appear as 
               glyphs.  At mid zoom levels, the main compound nodes appear as molecular formulas.  At high zoom levels, enzymes and 
               side nodes appear as formulas, terms or Enzyme commission numbers. Clicking on a node will retrieve details about the 
               node, regardless of zoom level.

    <p><strong>We are pleased to announce the release of TrichDB 36</strong></p>
      
      <section>
      <h3><b>New features in this release</b></h3>
      <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
      
      <h4>Search Page Improvements: search pages were redesigned to include an organism filter and provide better access to help information.</h4>
      
          <ul>
            <li>Search parameters are now left justified. The Get Answer button remains center justified below the parameters. Parameter help 
                icons, which offer information concerning the parameters when hovered over, now appear before the parameter name instead of after.
                </li>
            <li>The Organism Parameter, the first parameter on search pages, has a new look and now contains a filter box for quickly finding 
                your organism of interest.  Type any portion of an organism name (at leaset two letters of the genus, species, or strain) 
                in the filter box and the tree collapses to show 
                only those organisms containing your entry.  To return to the full tree, click the X in the filter box.  
                </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>New Paralog Count search</h4>
      
          <ul>
            <li>The new 
                <a href="/a/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=GeneQuestions.GenesByParalogCount">Paralog Count search</a>
                returns genes based on the number of assigned paralogs. Find genes that have a number of paralogs within the specified range. 
                Paralogs are defined as genes from the same species that belong to the same OrthoMCL group.
                </li>
            <li>Find the search under the Orthology and Synteny category.
                </li>
          </ul>

    
       
       <h4>Gene Record Page Improvements:</h4>
 
          <ul>
            <li>A new GO Slim table now appears above the GO Term table on the record pages of genes with GO associated data. 
                The GO Slim table maps GO Terms form the GO Term table to their GO Slim terms based on the 
                <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/page/go-slim-and-subset-guide" target="_blank">Generic GO slim developed by GO Consortium</a>.
                </li>
            <li>Column headers in gene page tables now show a help icon (
                <img src="/a/images/HelpIcon.png"  height="15px" width="16px">)
                when additional information or definitions are available 
                for the column. Hover over the help icons to reveal additional information.  
                </li>
            <li>Metabolic pathway and reaction tables on gene pages now include reaction compound names, with CHEBI IDs on mouse over, 
                and a column that indicates if the EC number associated with a gene is an exact match to the EC number in metabolic pathway.   
                </li>
          </ul>

        
        <h4>Search Strategy Improvement: new option for combining steps in a search strategy. </h4>
       
          <ul>
            <li>Search strategies now offer an option to 'ignore' a step when editing a multi-step strategy. To remove a search 
                from the strategy without deleting the step, click Edit for the combine graphic of the step you are interested in ignoring. 
                Then choose 'IGNORE step #' from the Revise Operation popup. For more information see this 
                <a href="/a/images/ignoreStep.jpg">Ignore Step help document</a>.

                </li>
            <li>The GO enrichment analysis has an option for limiting the analysis to GO Slim terms. This will limit both 
                the background and the gene list of interest in the Fisher's exact test that determines enrichment.

        <div style="margin-left: 3em;">
        
        In the transcriptomics section of gene pages, expression graphs display FPKM or RPKM values determined from uniquely aligned 
        reads (those that align to one location only). The coverage section shows plots of unique reads aligned to the genome.  
        This may underrepresent abundance for genes that are duplicated, such as paralogs. Non-unique reads are only available 
        as GBrowse subtracks. To view non-unique reads from a gene page, open the Coverage section and click 'View in 
        genome browser' above the coverage plots. 
        (<a href="/trichdb/images/FromCoverageNonuniqueReads.pdf">Tutorial document about viewing non-unique reads from a gene page</a>)
        
        <br><br>
        To view non-unique reads without navigating to the gene page, open GBrowse from the home page.  Use the Select Tracks 
        tab to turn on the data track of interest and the subtracks configuration tool to turn on the non-unique reads subtracks. 
        (<a href="/trichdb/images/FromHomeNonuniqueReads.pdf">Tutorial document for viewing non-unique reads from the home page</a>)
        
        <br><br>
        In release 34, gene pages contain a message about non-unique reads, an accurate description of the y-axis and links to 
        tutorials on how to display non-unique reads.  Future releases will offer searches based on the non-unique reads and 
        their contribution to expression. 
        
        <br><br>
        For future releases, we are working to implement a graphic visualization that provides information about both unique and a non-unique reads.

    <h3>TrichDB 29</h3>
           TrichDB 29 represents extensive efforts to improve navigation and data accessibility 
           on record pages, provide consistent verbiage and data categories, and improve presentation of alternative transcripts. 
           All data were refreshed to the latest version and genome analyses were rerun.
           <ul>
             <li>Here is some help information to get you started with our new features.<br>

      <h3>New Features</h3>
         
           <ul>
             <li>Data Categories - <br>Searches, data and GBrowse tracks are now categorized according to the 
             <a href="http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/EDAM?iri=http://edamontology.org/topic_3070">EMBRACE Data & Methods Ontology (EDAM)</a>. 
             This offers a controlled vocabulary and consistent data structure throughout the site. 
             </li><br>
             <li>Record Pages Redesigned - <br>Gene pages, and in-fact all our record pages, have a new structure. 
             Features include a new streamlined and uncluttered look, new navigation tools, and improved 
             tables with search functions for quickly finding and displaying the data you want. 
             </li><br>
             <li>Transcripts Represented on Gene Pages and Search Results - <br>Transcripts are graphically represented on 
             gene pages and listed in gene page tables when data can be 
             unambiguously assigned to a transcript. All search results now 
             contain a Transcript ID column.  The results of searches that query transcript-specific 
             data (e.g. Predicted Signal Peptide) contain an Explore function for investigating transcript subsets.
             </li><br>
             <li>Galaxy Workspace - <br> EuPathDB sites now include a Galaxy-based workspace for large-scale data analyses. 
             Developed in partnership with <a href="https://www.globus.org/genomics">Globus Genomics</a>, 
             workspaces offer a private analysis platform with published workflows and pre-loaded annotated genomes. 
             The workspace is accessed through the "Analyze My Experiment" tab on the home page of any EuPathDB resource

             workflows and data analyses with colleagues.

             <li>Download Search Result Redesigned - <br>The page for downloading search results and associated data has 
             an improved design that reflects the new ontological data categories and offers the ability to download 
             all transcripts per gene when downloading gene results.
             </li><br>
             <li>RNA Sequencing Workflow - We updated our RNA sequencing analysis. The new workflow aligns 
             reads with GSNAP, calculates FPKM/RPKM from HT-Seq counts and determines differential expression with DESeq2.

        Changes in annotation and new experimental data may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the number of hits.
        When search parameters change with a new release, we invalidate (Ø) the search and ask you to rerun it.
        When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites page alone.

         <![CDATA[
<body>
    <p>Dear colleagues -<br>
      <br>
      We are writing to provide an update on the Eukaryotic Pathogen Genomics
      Resource (<a href="http://EuPathDB.org">EuPathDB.org</a>), which many
      hundreds of laboratories wrote to support in connection with our
      application for renewal as an NIH Bioinformatics Resource Center for
      Infectious Diseases.&nbsp; We are pleased to report that the EuPathDB
      contract has now been renewed.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to continuing to integrate the ever-increasing volume of
      Omic-scale datasets available for microbial eukaryotes, new
      functionalities anticipated over the coming months include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>full integration of FungiDB into the EuPathDB family of databases</li>
      <li>reorganization of EuPathDB record pages, so as to improve
        navigability, better accommodate curated annotation (when available),
        represent alternative transcripts, summarize functional genomic results,
        etc</li>
      <li>better representation of experimental metadata, including phenotyping
        and clinical/field results</li>
      <li>enhanced functionality of the host response database (<a href="http://HostDB.org">HostDB.org</a>)</li>
      <li>improved handling of metabolic pathways, including incorporation of
        metabolomic datasets</li>
      <li>better support for orthology-based queries and cross-species inference</li>
      <li>implementation of workspaces enabling users to upload and analyze
        their own data (e.g. RNA-seq results)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
      The scope of this renewal extends beyond our previous mandate, which
      officially covered only biosecurity threats (Cryptosporidium, Entamoeba,
      Giardia, Toxoplasma, etc) and reemerging pathogens (e.g.
      Plasmodium).&nbsp; This makes it easier for us to leverage EuPathDB
      infrastructure in support of the kinetoplastida, oomycetes, fungi, and
      other microbial eukaryotes, including both pathogenic and non-pathogenic
      species.<br>
      <br>
      The scale of the EuPathDB award from NIH does not provide adequate funding
      for full support of the TriTrypDB or FungiDB projects (unfortunately) ...
      but the Wellcome Trust has agreed to consider an application covering
      these initiatives, augmenting our existing award for kinetoplastid
      resources.&nbsp; We will be contacting users of these databases shortly
      for their support.<br>
      <br>
      As always, we look forward to feedback from database users, via the
      'Contact Us' link on all EuPathDB web sites, face-to-face discussions at
      major meetings, etc.<br>
      <br>

    <p>We are pleased to announce the 9th annual EuPathDB workshop to be held in
      Athens, Georgia, USA from June 15 to Wednesday, June 18, 2014.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <br>
      <br>
      Please note that the workshop expenses, in addition to room and board
      costs are covered by EuPathDB (see cost and fees section below).&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Come learn how to effectively use EuPathDB resources and mine available
      data to help guide your research.<br>
      <br>
      For more information and to apply, please visit:
      http://workshop.eupathdb.org/current/<br>
      <br>
      The workshop will cover all of our component databases (EuPathDB,
      AmoebaDB, CryptoDB, GiardiaDB, MicrosporidiaDB, PlasmoDB, PiroplasmaDB,
      ToxoDB, TrichDB, TriTrypDB and OrthoMCL), and will run from 6:00PM (18:00)
      on Sunday, June 15 to 5:00PM (17:00) on Wednesday, June 18, 2014.<br>
      <br>
      The application deadline is February 28, 2014 and the course is limited to
      30 participants.<br>
      <br>
      <em><strong>Who should apply:</strong></em>&nbsp; This workshop is
      intended to be a 3 day thorough and intensive introduction to database
      resources that are part of the EuPathDB.org Bioinformatics Resource Center
      (EuPathDB, AmoebaDB, CryptoDB, GiardiaDB, MicrosporidiaDB, PlasmoDB,
      PiroplasmaDB, ToxoDB, TrichDB, TriTrypDB and OrthoMCL). The ideal
      candidate would have a need to become an expert user of one or more of
      these database resources and presumably has a bioinformatics research
      problem that they might work on as part of their training while attending
      the course. Preference will be given to applicants that are in a position
      to benefit most from intensive training and that are in a position to
      return to their home institution and transfer their newly acquired
      knowledge to others. Evaluation of the applications will focus heavily on
      your responses to the questions asked on the application page and on
      letters of recommendation.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <strong><em>Costs and Fees:</em> </strong>The course is free. Housing
      (double occupancy), all training materials and lunches are covered.
      Attendees are expected to provide their own transportation to the course
      and pay for a few of their meals. Letters of acceptance will be mailed
      early to facilitate the solicitation of outside travel funds.<br>
      <br>
      Hotel room charges for a shared room will be paid by EuPathDB for the
      nights of June 15 through June 18. Attendees who would like to have a
      private room will need to pay the difference of $47 per night plus
      tax.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      For more information and to apply, please visit:
      http://workshop.eupathdb.org/current/<br>
      <br>
      If you have any questions or concerns please email help@eupathdb.org<br>

      their training while attending the course. Preference will be given to
      applicants that are in a position to benefit most from intensive training
      and that are in a position to return to their home institution and
      transfer their newly acquired knowledge to others. Evaluation of the
      applications will focus heavily on your responses to the questions asked
      on the application page and on letters of recommendation.<br />
      <br />
      Costs and Fees: The course is free. Housing, all training materials and
      most meals are covered. Attendees are expected to provide their own
      transportation to the course and pay for a few of their meals. No travel
      funds are available. Letters of acceptance will be mailed early to
      facilitate the solicitation of outside travel funds. Hotel room charges
      will be paid by EuPathDB from June 2 through 11:00am June 6 (Note: course
      ends at 5PM on June 5). Participants traveling from abroad may be able to
      arrive a day early or stay a day late as needed to accommodate travel
      arrangements.<br />

<body>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">We are pleased to
announce new features in TrichDB<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">New
functionality:</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
</span>
<ul>
<li>The genome browser has been updated.&nbsp; This newer version
includes several improvements and functionalities.&nbsp; <a

the new features is also available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>A new column analysis tool is now available that allows you to
generate a word cloud or histogram based on the data in result
columns.&nbsp; To access this feature, run any search that returns a
list of results then click on the icon next to the product description
column name.&nbsp; This will reveal a popup with the option to select
"Word Cloud".&nbsp; Look for this analysis feature to be activated on
additional columns in future releases.</li>

Our bimonthly database releases incorporate new data and correct old
data when necessary.&nbsp; Changes in annotation and new experimental
data
may slightly alter your search results by increasing or decreasing the
number of hits. When search parameters change with a new release, we
invalidate (<span style="color: red;">Ø</span>) the search and ask you
to rerun it. When IDs are updated or removed, we map the old IDs to the
new ones, remove the old IDs from your Basket, and leave your Favorites
page alone.</span></span><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">New Features in TrichDB</span><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>You can now search for DNA segments defined by their chromosomal
location or their nucleotide sequence (DNA motif pattern).&nbsp; This
new search is available under "Identify Other Data Types"; click on
"Genomic Segments (DNA motif)" then select either <a
style="font-weight: bold;"
href="http://trichdb.org/trichdb/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=SpanQuestions.DynSpansByMotifSearch">DNA
motif pattern</a> or <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Location</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br>
</div>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>We introduced a new combine operation that allows users to
combine
steps based on relative locations on the genome.&nbsp; This enables
you, for
example, to return all genes that contain a specific DNA motif within
1000 nucleotides upstream of the annotated start site. Or you could
return all genes that have a SNP between two strains within 500
nucleotides of the start of the gene (or return all SNPs that are
located in this region relative to genes).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<ul>
<li>Here is an <a style="font-weight: bold;"
href="http://trichdb.org/trichdb/im.do?s=e892ef6112576c45">example
search strategy</a> that identifies protein coding genes with an AP-2
like motif within 1000 bp of their 5' end.</li>

<b>We are pleased to report that the following Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) have been awarded in connection with the EuPathDB Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC):</b><br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>The Toxoplasma oocyst transcriptome and proteome</b><br>
   John Boothroyd, Matt Bogyo (Stanford) & Pat Conrad (UC Davis)<br>
   This project is expected to yield expression data from an important, but inaccessible, life cycle stage (1 yr). <br><br></li>
<li><b>A comprehensive catalog of the T. gondii & N. caninum parasite & infected host cell transcriptome & proteome</b><br>
   Brian Gregory (Univ. Pennsylvania) & Jonathan Wastling (Univ. Liverpool)<br>
   This project will produce an immense volume of sequence data, driving database improvements for handling 'next-gen' sequencing, non-coding RNAs, and interrogating host & pathogen datasets in parallel (2 yr).<br><br></li>

<li><b>Dissection of Plasmodium falciparum genetic crosses by mass spectrometry-based metabolite QTL</b><br>
   Manuel Llin&aacute;s (Princeton) & Michael Ferdig (Notre Dame)<br>
   This project is expected to improve handling of genetic mapping data, incorporation of metabolomics results (integrated with pathway maps), and linking of specific genetic loci with metabolite abundance (2 yr).<br><br></li>
</ul>

A biennial competition for DBP awards is mandated by the BRC contract from NIH/NIAID, and supported by a total of $1.2M in total costs per award cycle.  The goal of this program is to produce high value genomic-scale datasets for the EuPathDB user community, and drive the further development of bioinformatics resources for data analysis and mining.<br><br>

Letters of intent (LOI) were solicited in February (see Feb 4 News item), and reviewed by the EuPathDB Scientific Working Group (SWG; see News, March 31).  12 full applications were solicited from among the ~50 LOIs received, and awards were based on further scientific review by the SWG, and in consultation with NIAID program staff.  Cost negotiations and 'in kind' contributions from other sources made it possible to support 3 applications, from 6 investigators (in some cases, more than one LOI was merged into a single award).<br><br>

We received far more high quality proposals than could be supported, testifying to the need for such mechanisms for data production bioinformatics analysis.  The EuPathDB team looks forward to working with members of our user community who are seeking funding for such projects from external sources.  Inquiries, including requests for support letters, should be directed to the EuPathDB staff (click on the 'Contact Us' link).<br><br>

<b>A new solicitation for DBPs is anticipated in 2011, and will be announced on the EuPathDB web site.</b>

<body>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">We are pleased to
announce the release of TrichDB 1.2<br>
<br>
<br>
This release of TrichDB contains the following new datasets and
features:</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;<br>
<br>
New Data:</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">T. vaginalis</span>
proteomic data&nbsp;graciously provided
pre-publication by the Patricia Johnson laboratory. &nbsp;Searching
this data can be performed via the <a
 href="http://trichdb.org/trichdb/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=GeneQuestions.GenesByMassSpec">Mass
spec. evidence search page</a> in TrichDB.</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Features introduced this year:<br>
</span>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"My
Basket"</span> allows one to cherry pick genes and add them to
the basket for subsequent conversion into a step in a strategy.
&nbsp;The basket is accessible from the gray menu bar and the
number of items in your basket is indicated.</li>
  <br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Weighted
searches</span>&nbsp;allows you to assign an arbitrary weight
to the searches (steps) in
your search strategy making it possible for you to view a ranked list
of your results. &nbsp;</li>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Here is an example of
the
same strategy looking for putative secretory enzymes. &nbsp;Notice
that you
have a larger number of results with weighting and those can be sorted
based on the sum of the weights, giving a ranked list of results.<br>
  <br>
  <a href="http://trichdb.org/trichdb/im.do?s=943679804a1cf881">Putative
secretory enzyme (unweighted)</a><br>
  <br>
  <a href="http://trichdb.org/trichdb/im.do?s=abc006f322db8e95">Putative
  </a><a
 href="http://trichdb.org/trichdb/im.do?s=abc006f322db8e95">secretory
enzyme</a><a
 href="http://trichdb.org/trichdb/im.do?s=abc006f322db8e95">
(Weighted)</a></div>
  <br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"My
Favorites"</span> (new in this release) allows you to bookmark
and organize genes you
access frequently. &nbsp;A tutorial on how to use this feature is
available <a
 href="http://eupathdb.org/tutorials/Favorites/favorites_viewlet_swf.html">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Feature evaluators still needed:<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">We welcome you to *sign
up* to be an early evaluator of new features on the EuPathDB sites.
This will be an opportunity for you to help us refine and improve
features early in the development process.&nbsp;In fact, the "My
Favorites" feature was the subject of our first survey and feature
evaluator's comments and suggestions contributed to enhancing this
feature. <br>
<br>
Signing on is easy and will
require minimal effort on your part in the form of answering questions
or rendering your opinion. &nbsp;<br>

(Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK), the Eukaryotic Pathogen Bioinformatics Resource Center 
(University of Georgia and University of Pennsylvania, US), and the Seattle Biomedical Research Institute (US). 
This residential workshop aims to provide experimental biologists with hands-on experience in 
genomic-scale data analysis, including genome browsers and comparison tools, methods for 
data integration, and resources for sophisticated data mining.
Many examples and exercises will be drawn from the kinetoplastida, including <i>Leishmania spp.</i>, 
<i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, and <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>, although applicants working on other protozoan 
parasites will also benefit.<br><br>

announce the implementation of new features in TrichDB:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Identify Genes based on Orthology Phylogenetic
Profile:&nbsp; For example you may ask for genes in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">T. vaginalis&nbsp;</span>that
do not have orthologs in mammals.&nbsp; Click here to explore this
feature.</li>
  <li>A table of paralogs (if any) is now available on gene pages
allowing you to view expanded gene families -- See <a
 href="http://trichdb.org/trichdb/app/record/gene/TVAG_386080">TVAG_386080</a>
for example (scroll down to the Orthologs and Paralogs Table).</li>
  <li>Now after you perform a BlastN against genomic sequence you
can link from the blast output to the correct coordinates in the
genome browser.&nbsp; This allows you to explore annotation and
other functional data in relation to your BLAST hits.</li>
  <li>The type ahead feature has been implemented for GO term, EC
number and Interpro domain searches.</li>
  <li>You can now edit or delete your user comments.</li>
  <li>You can now modify your user profile, change your password
or your email address.</li>
</ul>
<br>
We are still collecting data sets for an upcoming release of
TrichDB.&nbsp; This release will include a large expansion in data
content and we look forward to receiving more data sets from you.<br>
<br>
Also, check out the new version of <a href="http://eupathdb.org">EuPathDB</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
EuPathDB permits searches across all organism-specific sites and now
includes the strategy system.&nbsp;Build multi-step searches using
a graphical interface that is feature-rich. You can save your
strategies, modify any step in a strategy or even share your strategy
with other scientists.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
The EuPathDB team.

We are pleased to report
an award from the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org">Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</a> in support of a
TrypDB component of the <a href="http://eupathdb.org/">EuPathDB</a> family of databases,
encompassing <i>Leishmania</i> species, <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, and
<i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>.  A coordinated award from the<a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/"> Wellcome Trust</a>
will permit enhanced annotation of kinetoplastid parasites. 
These projects represent a collaborative effort between the
GeneDB team (at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute), colleagues
at the <a href="http://www.sbri.org/">Seattle Biomedical Research Institute</a>, and the EuPathDB
team -- an NIAID-supported Bioinformatics Resource Center. Look
for the first release of TrypDB in Jan 2009!

We are pleased to announce the release of TrichDB  (<a href="http://trichdb.org/">http://trichdb.org</a> )  a new Web resource for interrogating the Trichomonas vaginalis genome, which was sequenced and annotated at The Institute for Genomics Research and published in Science magazine in early 2007.
<br><br>
TrichDB is modeled after the ApiDB family of apicomplexan genome database query sites (<a href="http://apidb.org">http://www.apidb.org</a>).  Like those sites, TrichDB offers researchers a plethora of  tools for genomic data mining.  In addition to BLAST and pattern/motif similarity searches, users can identify T. vaginalis genes by genomic position; common name or keyword; gene attributes such as gene type and exon number; transcript expression evidence (ESTs including prepublication ESTs kindly provided by Dr. Petrus Tang and collaborators); physical characteristics of predicted proteins such as molecular weight and secondary structure;  predicted function from Gene Ontology and EC enzyme number annotation;  and cellular location.  Along with these tools for gene analysis there are also identification tools for ESTs and ORFs. A special feature of TrichDB is the ability to separately query repeat genes, which constitute a large fraction of the T. vaginalis genome.
<br><br>
TrichDB couples a comprehensive set of querying tools with extensively hyperlinked and highly-configurable displays of results. Numerous evidence types and data associated with a gene, including gene context, predicted protein, EST and BLAST alignments, and %GC content, can be displayed in a single graphic.  Users can choose just which elements to show in a display, allowing them to generate purpose-built images for presentation.
<br><br>
Finally, TrichDB is also a repository for T. vaginalis genome statistics, data and methods source links, links to other Trichmonas community web sites,  and daily updates of Trichomonas publications and genes deposited in Pubmed/Entrez.  New users can learn to use the TrichDB/ApiDB sites via a set of online tutorials linked from the TrichDB front page.
<br><br>
We hope you will take time to explore TrichDB. Please use the link found at the bottom of every TrichDB page to send us feedback  (<a href="http://trichdb.org/trichdb/contact.do" class="new-window" data-name="contact_us">Contact Us!</a>).  We look forward to hearing from you!
<br><br>
Best regards,
<br>
The TrichDB Team
