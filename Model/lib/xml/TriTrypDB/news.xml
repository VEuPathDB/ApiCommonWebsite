(Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK), the Eukaryotic Pathogen Bioinformatics Resource Center 
(University of Georgia and University of Pennsylvania, US), and the Seattle Biomedical Research Institute (US). 
This residential workshop aims to provide experimental biologists with hands-on experience in 
genomic-scale data analysis, including genome browsers and comparison tools, methods for 
data integration, and resources for sophisticated data mining.
Many examples and exercises will be drawn from the kinetoplastida, including <i>Leishmania spp.</i>, 
<i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, and <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>, although applicants working on other protozoan 
parasites will also benefit.<br><br>

<li>Sequence and annotation for <i>Leishmania braziliensis</i>, <i>L. infantum</i>, <i>L. major</i>, <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> and <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>.</li>
<li>Genome sequence alignments, permitting comparative genomic analysis of synteny (<i>T. cruzi</i> scaffolds assembled into virtual chromosomes, distinguishing 'Esmeraldo' and 'non-Esmeraldo' haplotypes).</li>
<li>Expression data, including ESTs and proteomics evidence for <i>L. infantum</i>, <i>T. brucei</i> and <i>T. cruzi</i> (from several laboratories, much of it made available prior to publication).</li>
<li>Phenotypic information, including manually curated RNAi knock-down phenotypes for <i>T. brucei</i> from TrypanoFAN and the published literature, aiding functional analysis and the validation of essential targets.</li>
<li>'User Comments' may be added to any gene page, enhancing available annotation.  Such comments are visible and searchable by others, and will be automatically forwarded to the annotation team.</li>
<li>Identification of genes based on text terms, ID #, GO terms, EC #, chromosomal location, BLAST, sequence features (length/MW, introns, signal sequences, Pfam domains, user-defined motifs), structure, epitopes, orthology, functional information, etc.</li>
<li>Support for integrated searches, via 'Query History', such as:</li>
  <ul>
  <li>"Find all <i>T. brucei</i> genes for which siRNA-mediated knock-downs yield a lethal phenotype"</li>
  <li>"Find <i>L. major</i> kinases without human orthologs that are supported by expression evidence in any kinetoplastid parasite"</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

We are pleased to announce the availability of a beta-release version of TriTrypDB, accessible at <a href="http://beta.TriTrypDB.org">http://beta.TriTrypDB.org</a>.  Feel free to forward this link to others.  <br><br>Highlights include:<br><br>


&#x2023; Sequence and annotation for <i>Leishmania braziliensis</i>, <i>L. infantum</i>, <i>L. major</i>, <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> and <i>T. cruzi</i>.  All current annotations from <a href="http://www.genedb.org">GeneDB</a> have been incorporated into TriTrypDB 1.0.<br>
&#x2023; Genes may be queried based on gene IDs, text terms, EC numbers, GO terms, sequence features (length, introns, signal sequences, Pfam domains), etc.<br>
&#x2023; Genes and sequences may also be interrogated based on BLAST similarity, user-defined motifs, etc.<br>
&#x2023; <i>T. cruzi</i> scaffolds have been assembled into virtual chromosomes, distinguishing the 'Esmeraldo' and 'non-Esmeraldo' haplotypes.<br>
&#x2023; Alignments between all available genome sequences, permitting comparative genomic analysis of synteny and convenient downloads of aligned sequences.<br>
&#x2023; Expression data, including Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) evidence, and proteomics evidence for <i>L. infantum</i>, <i>T. brucei</i> and <i>T. cruzi</i> (from several laboratories, much of it kindly made available prior to publication).<br>
&#x2023; Phenotypic information from <a href="http://www.genedb.org">GeneDB</a>, including manually curated RNAi knock-down phenotypes for <i>T. brucei</i> from <a href="http://trypanofan.path.cam.ac.uk/trypanofan/main/">TrypanoFAN</a> and the published literature, aiding functional analysis and the validation of essential targets.<br>
&#x2023; Identification of orthologs, permiting inferences for one species based on evidence from others.  For example you might want to identify <i>L. major</i> genes that are orthologs of essential <i>T. brucei</i> kinases, or <i>T. cruzi</i> proteins supported by expression evidence in any kinetoplastid species.<br>
&#x2023; &#39;User Comments&#39; may be added to any gene page, enhancing available annotation.  Such comments are visible and searchable by others, and will be automatically forwarded to the annotation team.<br><br>

By providing access to TriTrypDB prior to its official release, we hope to obtain valuable feedback to facilitate the debugging process, in addition to making this resource available to the community as early as possible.  Please click on the &#39;Contact Us&#39; link at the bottom of each page to indicate anything that might help to make the site better: bugs, help requests, features that are unclear or take too long to run, suggestions for additional tools or datasets that might be useful to incorporate, etc.  Where appropriate, please also add to the &#39;User Comments&#39; on each gene page, noting inaccurate (or accurate) gene models, expression data, clone availability, etc.

We are pleased to report
an award from the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org">Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</a> in support of a
TriTrypDB component of the <a href="http://eupathdb.org/">EuPathDB</a> family of databases,
encompassing <i>Leishmania</i> species, <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, and
<i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>.  A coordinated award from the<a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/"> Wellcome Trust</a>
will permit enhanced annotation of kinetoplastid parasites. 
These projects represent a collaborative effort between the
GeneDB team (at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute), colleagues
at the <a href="http://www.sbri.org/">Seattle Biomedical Research Institute</a>, and the EuPathDB
team -- an NIAID-supported Bioinformatics Resource Center. Look
for the first release of TriTrypDB in Jan 2009!
