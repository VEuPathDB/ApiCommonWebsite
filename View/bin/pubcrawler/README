this directory contains:
  - pubcrawlerOriginal.pl    : the pubcrawler.pl as download from pubcrawler 
  - pubcrawlerApi.pl         : a modified version of that for the Api project
  - pubcrawlerXXXX.sh        : a project specific .sh to call the .pl file
  - pubcrawler.config.sample : in the target dir, copy this to 
                               pubcrawler.config and change the last few lines
                               (its obvious how)
  - spacer.gif               : a 1x1 pixel spacer needed by pubcrawler


to install pubcrawler in an Api site:
  1) make the directory my_web_dir/Common  (a dir in which Common resources are kept)
  2) cp -r ApiCommonWebsite/View/bin/pubcrawler my_web_dir/Common
  3) In Apache's config file for the site's VirtualHost, 
     add an alias for the pubcrawler directory
        Alias /pubcrawler/ "my_web_dir/Common/pubcrawler/"
     Reload Apache.
  4) copy the pubcrawler.config.sample to pubcrawler.config and change the
     last few lines
  5) test by running pubcrawlerMYPROJECT.sh.  it should produce a log, db and
     index.html file. See the results at http://www.___db.org/pubcrawler/
  6) to update nightly, add the following to the crontab file (typically, /etc/crontab):
          00 3 * * * root my_web_dir/Common/pubcrawler/pubcrawlerMYPROJECT.sh
